# SRE/Service Owner Persona - Root Cause Analysis with Grafana Cloud

## Scenario: Responding to Service Escalation

### Context
You don't know anything about the recommendation service, but you've received an escalation from the frontend team reporting errors. Multiple alerts are also firing for this service.

### Step 1: Open RCA Workbench
**Escalation received, alerts triggered â†’ kick off root cause analysis.**

Receive the escalation from the frontend team about recommendation service errors. Navigate through the recommendation alert to access the RCA (Root Cause Analysis) Workbench.

**Understanding the RCA Workbench:**
- The workbench displays rings representing different layers of your infrastructure and services
- Each ring shows the health and status of components at that layer
- This visualization helps quickly identify where problems originate

### Step 2: RCA Analysis
**Spot the outlier POD showing OOM restarts/crash loops.**

**Identify Outliers:**
- The RCA Workbench highlights outliers - components behaving differently from their peers
- These outliers are often the root cause of incidents

Add the outlier POD to your investigation and examine its KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
- Observe OOM (Out Of Memory) restarts in the pod metrics
- Identify crash loop pattern - the pod is continuously restarting due to memory issues

### Step 3: CPU Profiling
**Drill into flame graph with AI assistance to pinpoint the culprit.**

Find CPU profiles for the recommendation service using `process/cpu/samples` metrics.

**Analyze Profile Types:**
- Start with drilldown profile types for the service
- View the flame graph visualization

**Understanding the Flame Graph:**
- Use AI assistance to explain the flame graph, as it's unclear what's happening
- The flame graph shows which functions are consuming the most CPU time
- After the flame graph explanation, ask the AI to also explain the OOM kills

The analysis reveals the specific code path or function causing excessive memory consumption.

### Step 4: Resolution
**Restart with more memory + log GitHub issue for long-term fix.**

**Immediate Fix:**
- Restart the recommendation service with increased memory allocation
- This resolves the immediate production issue

**Long-term Fix:**
- File a GitHub issue for the development team to investigate and fix the underlying memory leak or inefficient code
- Include all relevant details: flame graph, OOM patterns, and AI analysis from the RCA workbench
